In order to make you as successful as possible during your time here, we have collected readings and exercises for you to complete prior to beginning Mod 1. This capstone helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their time at Turing.

## Capstone Overview

The Mod 0 Capstone is divided into two sections: Professional Development and Technical. You are required to spend at least 8 days completing these assignments, however it is recommended that you start as soon as possible. If you have more than a week to dedicate to the capstone, make sure you continue to code every day after you have completed the assignments. You SHOULD NOT complete the capstone early and take an extended break from coding before your first day of class. This is very important to make sure you are in a routine that will keep your skills sharp and prepare you to hit the ground running on day 1.
